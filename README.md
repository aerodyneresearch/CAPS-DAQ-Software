# CAPS-DAQ-Software
Data Acquisition system for CAPS Monitors

CAPS-DAQ is a user interface and data acquisition system for the Aerodyne 
series of CAPS monitors. It can be used to control the monitor and to log data. 
The software is designed to work with all CAPS monitors sold by Aerodyne Research. 
Once connected to a monitor it will query the instrument to identify the type 
and model of device and configure the user interface to control that specific 
instrument.

The software is designed to be straightforward to use. The menu bar contains 
commands for all of the common tasks you are likely to encounter when working 
with a CAPS monitor. The manual included with the software will give you the 
information you need to operate the instrument using the software.
